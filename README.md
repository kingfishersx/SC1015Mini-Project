# US Traffic Accidents

## About
This mini-project for SC1015 aims to predict when traffic accidents are most likely to occur. We will be using a dataset of [US Accidents from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents). Since this dataset is huge with more than 2.8 million records (>1 GB), we will be using ```opendatasets``` and kaggle API ("username":"testingqwerty","key": ***provided in assignment submission in NTULearn***) to download it.
